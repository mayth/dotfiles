# Notes
## vim
**be improved!!**
(some vim plugins don't support vi.)

[neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) requires vim 7.3.885 or later with `+lua`.
You may need to compile newer vim with lua option.

## clang
[vim-clang](https://github.com/justmao945/vim-clang) requires clang.

## pip
[jedi-vim](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim) requires [pip](https://pip.pypa.io),
so you should install Python with pyenv or install pip into the system's Python before starting vim.
